1
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,390
They ought to make the day the time
changes the first day of summer.

2
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,670
What?

3
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,830
Well, it's eight o'clock
and it's still light.

4
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,590
A lot of good
the extra daylight does us.

5
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,270
Now we've still got
a three-hour drive back.

6
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,190
We're not going to be home
until after midnight.

7
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,830
Well, if it really bugged you,
Johnny, you wouldn't do it.

8
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,590
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

9
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,710
You know, I figure we're either
gonna have to move mother out here,

10
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,230
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

11
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,230
She can't make
a trip like this.

12
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,390
I don't know that she can't.

13
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,310
- Is there any candy left?
- No.

14
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,950
Look at this thing.
"We still remember. "

15
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,430
I don't. You know,
I don't even remember what the man I

16
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,150
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

17
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,070
5 minutes to put the wreath on the grave
and 6 hours to drive back and forth.

18
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,270
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles into the count

19
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,270
and she stays at home.

20
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,150
Well, we're here, John, all right?

21
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,950
Radio: Testing... back on...
Ah, ladies and... We're coming back

22
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,350
on the air after an interruption
due to technical problem...

23
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,270
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

24
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,510
Which row is it in?

25
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,910
There's no one around.

26
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,670
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

27
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,470
Oh, look, I already lost
an hour's sleep in the time change.

28
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,510
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

29
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:15,150
There it is.

30
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,950
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

31
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,230
Each year we spend
good money on these things.

32
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,790
We come out here, and the
one from last year is gone.

33
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,670
Well, the flowers die,

34
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,350
And the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

35
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,790
Yeah, a little spit and polish,

36
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,030
he can clean this up sell it next year.

37
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,190
Wonder how many times
we bought the same one?

38
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,470
Hey, come on, Barb,
church was this morning, huh?

39
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,790
Hey, I mean,
praying's for church, huh? Come on.

40
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,710
I haven't seen you
in church lately.

41
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,670
Well, there's not much
sense in my going to church.

42
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,790
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

43
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,710
It was from right over there.

44
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,630
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree

45
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,270
And grandpa got all excited, and
he shook his fist at me, and he said,

46
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,590
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell. "

47
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,310
Remember that?
Right over there.

48
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,070
Well, you used
to really be scared here.

49
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,910
Johnny.

50
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,670
- Well, you're still afraid.
- Stop it now. I mean it.

51
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,310
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

52
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,150
Stop it. You're ignorant.

53
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:15,350
They're coming for you, Barbra.

54
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,270
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

55
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,070
They're coming for you.

56
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,230
Look! There comes one of them now.

57
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,790
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes. I getting out of here.

58
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,990
Johnny!

59
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,880
It's all right.

60
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Don't worry about him.
I can handle him.

61
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,880
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

62
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,440
Truck is outta gas.

63
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,480
This pump out here is locked.
Is there a key?

64
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,200
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas. Is there a key?

65
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,760
I suppose you've tried this.

66
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
Do you live here?

67
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,440
We've gotta get out of here.

68
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,640
We have to get where there
are some other people.

69
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,280
Maybe we better take some food.

70
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,320
I'll see if I can find some food.

71
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:39,128
Two of them.

72
00:19:44,128 --> 00:19:47,048
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

73
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:49,168
I can take care of those two.

74
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,648
- I know you're afraid, but we have to...
- I don't know! I don't know!

75
00:19:51,688 --> 00:19:53,648
What's happening?

76
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:09,497
They know we're in here now.

77
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:25,497
Don't look at it.

78
00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:37,897
Get some more lights on in this house.

79
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:04,325
There, this room looks pretty secure.

80
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:09,085
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

81
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:15,165
Won't be long before those things'll
be back, pounding their way in here.

82
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:18,565
They're afraid now.

83
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:22,965
They're afraid of fire.
I found that out.

84
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:38,153
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's diner?

85
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,553
Anyhow, that's where I found
that truck I have out there.

86
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,433
There's a radio in the truck.

87
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,713
I had jumped in to listen to it,

88
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:59,113
When a big gasoline truck came
screaming right across the road.

89
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:02,993
Well, there must have been
10-15 of those things chasing after it.

90
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:06,073
Grabbing and holding on.

91
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:11,193
Now, I didn't see them at first.

92
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:15,793
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

93
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:18,993
And those things
were catching up to it.

94
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:24,273
Truck went
right across the road.

95
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:28,113
Slammed on my brakes to keep
from hitting it myself.

96
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:30,433
It went right through
the guard rail.

97
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:40,193
I guess... I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

98
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:43,393
into that gas station
by Beekman's diner.

99
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:47,313
It went right through the billboard.
Ripped over a gas pump,

100
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:48,273
and never stopped moving.

101
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:50,993
By now it's like a moving bonfire.

102
00:26:54,073 --> 00:26:57,553
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

103
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:04,033
I can still hear the man, screaming.

104
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,473
This thing is
just backing away from it.

105
00:27:13,033 --> 00:27:16,153
I look back at the diner to see

106
00:27:16,193 --> 00:27:18,393
If there was anyone there
who could help me.

107
00:27:20,793 --> 00:27:22,873
That was when I noticed that

108
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:25,233
The entire place
had been encircled.

109
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,953
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

110
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:35,793
by now, there were no more screams.

111
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,673
I realized that...

112
00:27:40,913 --> 00:27:42,593
I was alone.

113
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,898
With 50 or 60
of those things.

114
00:27:45,593 --> 00:27:47,993
Just standing there,

115
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,633
staring at me.

116
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:54,073
I started to drive. I...

117
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:57,553
Just plowed right through them.

118
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:59,313
They didn't move.

119
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:04,833
They didn't run, or...
Just stood there, staring at me.

120
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:09,113
Just wanted to crush them.

121
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:17,193
They...
Scattered through the air, like bugs.

122
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:22,353
We were riding in the cemetery.

123
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:24,673
Johnny and me.

124
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:26,993
Johnny.

125
00:28:32,993 --> 00:28:36,993
We... we came to put a wreath
on my father's grave.

126
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:41,060
Johnny and...

127
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:48,507
Maybe... we'd better go out
and get him.

128
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:51,947
We have to go out and get Johnny.

129
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:53,427
He's out there.

130
00:28:54,507 --> 00:28:58,307
Please, don't you hear me?
We've got to go out and get him.

131
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:03,227
Please!
We have got to go get Johnny!

132
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:05,547
Please help me!

133
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,707
Look, don't you know what's going on out
there? This is no Sunday school picnic.

134
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:12,987
Don't you understand?
My brother is alone.

135
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:16,987
- Your brother is dead.
- No! My brother is not dead!

136
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:11,187
Because of the obvious threat
to untold numbers of citizens,

137
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:14,307
and because of the crisis
which is even now developing,

138
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:17,187
this radio station will remain
on the air, day and night.

139
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:21,841
This station and hundreds of other
radio and TV stations

140
00:30:21,876 --> 00:30:25,512
throughout this part of the country
are pooling their resources

141
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:30,392
through an emergency network hookup
to keep you informed of all developments.

142
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:33,952
At this hour, we repeat,
these are the facts as we know them.

143
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:36,556
There is an epidemic of mass murder

144
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:39,892
being committed by a virtual army
of unidentified assassins.

145
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:43,040
The murders are taking place
in villages, cities,

146
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:48,873
Rural homes and suburbs with no apparent
pattern or reason for the slayings.

147
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:53,443
It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.

148
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:56,473
We have some descriptions
of the assassins.

149
00:30:56,508 --> 00:30:59,428
Eyewitnesses say they are
ordinary looking people.

150
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:02,154
Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.

151
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,443
Others describe them as being
mis-shaped and monsters.

152
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:09,169
At this point there is
no really authentic way for us

153
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:12,085
to say who or what to look for
and guard yourself against.

154
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:14,430
Reaction of
law enforcement officials

155
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,807
is one of complete
bewilderment at this hour.

156
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:20,288
Police, sheriffs' deputies,
and emergency ambulances

157
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:23,030
are literally deluged
with calls for help

158
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:26,069
The scene can best be described
as mayhem.

159
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:29,446
Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,

160
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:32,532
along with the governors of several
eastern and midwestern states

161
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,745
have indicated the national guard
may be mobilized at any moment,

162
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:37,474
but that has not happened as yet.

163
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,350
The main advice news reporters have
been able to get from official sources

164
00:31:42,385 --> 00:31:47,049
is to tell private citizens to stay
in their homes behind locked doors.

165
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:50,260
Do not venture outside,
for any reason,

166
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:52,617
until the nature of this crisis
has been determined

167
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,537
and until we can advise
what course of action to take.

168
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:57,822
Keep listening to radio and TV

169
00:31:57,954 --> 00:32:01,174
for any special instructions
as this crisis develops further.

170
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:05,712
Thousands of office and factory
workers are being urged

171
00:32:05,747 --> 00:32:08,139
to stay at their places
of employment,

172
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:10,741
and not to make any attempt
to get to their homes.

173
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:13,492
However, in spite of this
urging and warning,

174
00:32:13,552 --> 00:32:16,394
streets and highways are packed
with frantic people

175
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:20,923
trying to reach their families,
or apparently to flee just anywhere.

176
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:27,243
I repeat: The safest course of action at
this time is simply to stay where you are.

177
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,889
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just received word

178
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:36,500
that the president has called
a meeting of his cabinet

179
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:39,019
to deal with
the sudden epidemic of murder

180
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:41,488
which has seized the eastern
third of this nation.

181
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,629
The meeting is scheduled
to convene within the hour.

182
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:47,458
Members of the presidential
cabinet will be joined

183
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:50,657
by officials of the FBI and
the military advisors.

184
00:32:50,858 --> 00:32:52,784
A White House spokesman
are saying,

185
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:54,680
there will be
an official announcement

186
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,314
immediately
following that meeting.

187
00:32:56,349 --> 00:33:00,403
This is the latest dispatch
just received in our newsroom.

188
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:06,006
Latest word also from national
press services in Washington, D.C.,

189
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:10,111
tells us that the emergency presidential
conference which we've just mentioned

190
00:33:10,146 --> 00:33:14,866
will include high-ranking scientists
from NASA.

191
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,224
The best advice they're
able to give the public

192
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,926
is this quote from Chief T.K. Dunbar
of Camden, North Carolina,

193
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:24,323
who's quoted as saying,

194
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,484
"Tell the people, for God's sake,
to get off the streets. "

195
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:30,125
"Tell 'em to go home and lock
their doors and windows up tight. "

196
00:33:30,336 --> 00:33:34,760
"We don't know what kind of murder-happy
characters we have here." End quote.

197
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:39,504
The Chief Dunbar of Camden,
North Carolina.

198
00:35:29,074 --> 00:35:31,082
Our newsmen,
who have been on the telephone

199
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:32,379
talking with officials
of other cities

200
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:35,419
have determined that none
of this kind of mass murder

201
00:35:35,454 --> 00:35:37,456
has yet been reported west of
the Mississippi river,

202
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:41,452
except in the extreme
southeastern portion of Texas.

203
00:35:41,853 --> 00:35:43,810
Similar killings
have been reported

204
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:46,047
around the Houston
and Galveston areas

205
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:47,518
but nothing like the...

206
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:59,895
We repeat, these are the
facts as we know them.

207
00:35:59,935 --> 00:36:02,499
There is an epidemic of mass murder

208
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:05,835
being committed by a virtual army
of unidentified assassins.

209
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,362
The murders are taking place
in villages, cities,

210
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:15,507
Rural homes and suburbs with no apparent
pattern or reason for the slayings.

211
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:19,386
It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.

212
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:22,416
We have some descriptions
of the assassins.

213
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:25,371
Eyewitnesses say they are
ordinary looking people.

214
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,097
Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.

215
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,386
Others describe them as being
mis-shaped and monsters.

216
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:35,112
At this point there is
no really authentic way for us

217
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:38,028
to say who or what to look for
and guard yourself against.

218
00:36:38,506 --> 00:36:40,373
Reaction of
law enforcement officials

219
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:42,993
is one of complete
bewilderment at this hour.

220
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:05,935
I found a gun
and some bullets out there.

221
00:37:08,775 --> 00:37:09,815
Oh, and these.

222
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:20,633
This place is boarded up
pretty solid now.

223
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:23,056
We ought to be all right here
for a while.

224
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,442
We have a gun and bullets,

225
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,414
Food and the radio,

226
00:37:30,756 --> 00:37:33,700
Sooner or later, someone's bound
to come and get us out.

227
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:38,508
So again, we join
with law enforcement agencies

228
00:37:38,543 --> 00:37:40,334
in urging you
to seek shelter in a building.

229
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:42,446
Lock the doors and windows
securely.

230
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:43,877
Hey, that's us.
We're doing all right.

231
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:45,446
Be cautious
of any suspicious strangers,

232
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:47,512
and keep tuned to your
radio and television

233
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,797
for survival instructions

234
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:51,085
and further details
of this continuing story.

235
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,036
Look, I don't know
if you're hearing me.

236
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,645
But I'm going upstairs now.

237
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,441
If anything should try to break in,
I can hear it from up there.

238
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:01,744
I'll be down
to take care of it.

239
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:05,441
Everything
is all right for now.

240
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:08,362
I'll be back to reinforce
the windows and doors later.

241
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,508
But you'll be all right
for now, ok?

242
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:14,260
Ok?

243
00:38:17,601 --> 00:38:19,597
Civil defense
officials in Cumberland

244
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:21,324
have told newsmen
that murder victims

245
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:25,802
show evidence of having been
partially devoured by their murderers.

246
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,156
Consistent reports from witnesses
to the effect that people

247
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:37,128
who acted
as though they were in a kind of trance

248
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:39,708
were killing and eating
their victims.

249
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:42,527
Prompted authorities to examine
the bodies of some of the victims.

250
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:46,492
Medical authorities in Cumberland
have concluded that in all cases

251
00:38:46,663 --> 00:38:50,697
the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they murdered.

252
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:54,726
Repeating this latest bulletin just
received moments ago from Cumberland.

253
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,796
Civil defense authorities
have told newsmen

254
00:38:56,831 --> 00:38:58,916
that murder victims show evidence

255
00:38:58,996 --> 00:39:01,755
of having been partially
devoured by their murderers.

256
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,356
Medical examination of victims' bodies
shows conclusively that

257
00:39:05,396 --> 00:39:08,156
the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they kill.

258
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:13,296
And so this incredible story
becomes more ghastly with each report.

259
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,635
It's difficult to imagine
such a thing actually happening

260
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:19,149
but these are the reports we have been
receiving and passing on to you,

261
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:22,290
Reports which have been verified
as completely as is possible

262
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:23,612
in this confused situation.

263
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:39,056
- Hold it!
- Don't shoot. We're from town.

264
00:39:39,091 --> 00:39:40,356
A radio!

265
00:39:41,356 --> 00:39:43,215
The Butler county sheriff
has verified that reports

266
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:46,481
of murder victims being partially
eaten by their slayers is true.

267
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:51,841
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

268
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:53,162
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

269
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,442
You mean you didn't hear the
racket we were making up here?

270
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:57,402
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

271
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:59,322
Could've been those things
for all we knew.

272
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:00,442
That girl was screaming.

273
00:40:00,477 --> 00:40:03,279
Surely you must know what
a girl screaming sounds like.

274
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:04,706
Those things don't make any noise.

275
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:06,569
Anybody would know
somebody needed help.

276
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,038
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

277
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,000
We thought we could hear screams,
but for all we knew,

278
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,207
that could have meant those things
were in the house after her.

279
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:17,289
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more...

280
00:40:17,324 --> 00:40:19,317
The racket sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

281
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:20,843
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

282
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:21,962
Now wait a minute.

283
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:24,866
You just got finished saying you
couldn't hear it from down there.

284
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:27,295
Now you say it sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

285
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,352
It would be nice if you'd get
your story straight, man.

286
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:31,646
All right, now you tell me.

287
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:35,497
I'm not going to take that kind of a
chance when we've got a safe place.

288
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:38,013
We luck into a safe place,
and you're telling us

289
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:41,154
we've gotta risk our lives just because
somebody might need help, huh?

290
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,214
- Yeah. Something like that.
- All right, why don't we settle this...

291
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:44,802
Look, mister!

292
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,013
We came up, ok? We're here.

293
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:49,534
Now I suggest
we all go back downstairs

294
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:51,610
before any of those things
find out we're in here.

295
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:52,713
They can't get in here.

296
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:54,523
You got the whole place boarded up?

297
00:40:54,558 --> 00:40:55,487
Yeah, most of it.

298
00:40:55,522 --> 00:40:58,477
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

299
00:40:58,512 --> 00:41:01,296
You are insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

300
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:03,204
I'm telling you,
they can't get in here.

301
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,045
And I'm telling you, those
things turned over our car.

302
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,871
We were damned lucky
to get away at all.

303
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:11,202
Now you tell me those... things can't
get through this lousy pile of wood?

304
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,162
His wife and kid's downstairs.
The kid's hurt.

305
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:18,882
Well, I still think
we're better off up here.

306
00:41:20,282 --> 00:41:22,162
We could strengthen
everything up, Mr. Cooper.

307
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:25,127
With all of us working, we could
fix this place up in no time.

308
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:26,727
We have everything
we need up here.

309
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,407
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

310
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:30,967
Man, you're really crazy,
you know that?

311
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,447
You got a million windows
up here.

312
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:33,727
All these windows.
You're gonna...

313
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:36,327
You're gonna make 'em strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

314
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:37,927
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

315
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:40,527
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

316
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:44,087
Did you hear me, what I told you?
They turned over our car.

317
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,887
Oh hell,
any good five men can do that.

318
00:41:45,927 --> 00:41:47,047
That's my point...

319
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,047
Only there's not going to be
five, or even ten.

320
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:51,847
There's gonna be twenty, thirty,
maybe a hundred of those things.

321
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,007
And as soon as they know we're here,

322
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:54,407
this place
is gonna be crawling with them.

323
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:57,567
Well, if there're that many, they'll
probably get us wherever we are.

324
00:41:58,207 --> 00:42:00,287
Look, the cellar.

325
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:02,167
The cellar.
There's only one door, right?

326
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:04,967
Just one door.
That's all we have to protect.

327
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:08,047
Tom and I fixed it so it locks
and boards from the inside.

328
00:42:08,287 --> 00:42:09,447
But up here, all these windows,

329
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:11,927
Why, we'd never know where
they were gonna hit us next.

330
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:13,287
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

331
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:16,127
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

332
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:19,647
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

333
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:22,327
We can get out of here
if we have to.

334
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:25,527
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

335
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:27,147
But down there, with no windows,

336
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:29,347
if a rescue party did come,
we wouldn't even know it.

337
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,667
But the cellar
is the strongest place.

338
00:42:31,707 --> 00:42:33,187
The cellar is a death trap.

339
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:36,827
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.

340
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,147
You know how many's out there?

341
00:42:39,187 --> 00:42:40,787
I don't know,
I figure maybe six or seven.

342
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:44,347
Look. You two can do
whatever you like.

343
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:48,027
I'm going back down to the cellar
and you better decide,

344
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,147
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

345
00:42:50,227 --> 00:42:52,267
and I'm not gonna unlock it
again no matter what happens.

346
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:53,627
Now wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.

347
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,587
No, I'm not gonna wait! I've made
my decision, now you make yours.

348
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,107
Now wait a minute!
Let's think about this.

349
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:01,307
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

350
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,187
And if we do decide to stay down there,
we'll need some things from up here.

351
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:07,627
So let's at least
consider this a while.

352
00:43:11,627 --> 00:43:12,747
If you box yourself in the cellar

353
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:15,067
and those things get in
the house, you've had it.

354
00:43:15,107 --> 00:43:17,267
At least up here,
you have a fighting chance.

355
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:23,227
Yeah, looks like about
eight or ten of them now.

356
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:27,067
That's more than there were.
There're a lot out back, too.

357
00:44:07,907 --> 00:44:10,787
Harry?
Harry, what's happening?

358
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:12,027
It's all right!

359
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:27,347
Now take it.

360
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,520
We've gotta fix these boards.

361
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,400
You're crazy!

362
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,320
Those things are gonna be at every
window and door in this place!

363
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,840
We've got to get down
into the cellar.

364
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,920
Go down into your damn cellar
and get out of here!

365
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,880
- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

366
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,600
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

367
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,120
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

368
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,480
and the radio and the food is
part of what I'm fighting for.

369
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,680
Now if you're going down
in the cellar, get.

370
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,218
The man's insane.
He's insane.

371
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,360
We've... we've got to have food
down there. We've got a right.

372
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,120
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

373
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,040
You going down there with him?

374
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,880
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

375
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,440
Listen, I got a kid down there.

376
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,640
She can't possib...
I couldn't bring her up here.

377
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,960
She can't possibly take
all the racket from those things

378
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,480
smashing through the windows.

379
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,760
Well, you're her father.

380
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,760
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

381
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,080
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

382
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,440
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

383
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,360
Now, get the hell down
in the cellar.

384
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,160
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

385
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,760
You bastards!

386
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,400
You know, I won't open
this door again. I mean it.

387
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,600
- Mr. Cooper, with your help...
- With my help.

388
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,720
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up.

389
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,560
Wait a minute.

390
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,600
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

391
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,360
You're gonna let them
get her too, huh?

392
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,280
It's all right, honey.
Go ahead.

393
00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:18,829
He's wrong, you know.

394
00:47:19,709 --> 00:47:21,549
I'm not boxing myself in
down there.

395
00:47:25,497 --> 00:47:28,838
Well, we're safe now.
It's boarded up tight.

396
00:47:29,737 --> 00:47:30,937
What about Tom and Judy?

397
00:47:31,137 --> 00:47:32,657
They wanna stay up there.
Let 'em.

398
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:41,777
There are... two other people upstairs.
A man and a girl.

399
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,377
We heard the screaming.

400
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:45,187
Yeah, but I didn't know
who they were,

401
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:48,317
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

402
00:47:48,377 --> 00:47:49,701
Of course not, Harry.

403
00:48:02,657 --> 00:48:05,237
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

404
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:07,983
She feels warm.
Maybe it's shock.

405
00:48:08,777 --> 00:48:10,257
Where'd you get the bandage?

406
00:48:10,777 --> 00:48:14,097
Some laundry in the basket.
I tore a sheet.

407
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:23,337
Let them stay upstairs.

408
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:25,297
Let them.

409
00:48:26,497 --> 00:48:29,097
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

410
00:48:30,377 --> 00:48:32,217
We'll see who's right.

411
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:35,657
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

412
00:48:35,757 --> 00:48:38,237
Mr. Cooper? They found
a television set upstairs.

413
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:41,571
Let's go up.

414
00:48:41,572 --> 00:48:45,172
Look, honey. Nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

415
00:48:45,612 --> 00:48:49,212
- Do this. For me.
- Ok.

416
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:51,892
Ok, open up.

417
00:49:13,132 --> 00:49:14,772
I'll take good care
of her, Helen.

418
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:19,372
She's all I have.

419
00:49:21,332 --> 00:49:22,732
Why don't you go upstairs now?

420
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:51,092
Her brother was killed.

421
00:49:54,932 --> 00:49:56,812
I gotta go help Ben
with the television.

422
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:16,825
Here, I have it. Drag a couple
of those chairs together.

423
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:18,395
There's a socket over here.

424
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,462
Now, you'd better watch this and try
to understand what's going on.

425
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:29,993
I don't want anyone's life
on my hands.

426
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:30,969
Is there anything
I can do to help?

427
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:32,609
I don't want to hear any more
from you, mister.

428
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:34,729
If you stay up here,
you take orders from me!

429
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:36,889
And that includes
leaving the girl alone.

430
00:50:37,169 --> 00:50:38,289
It's on! It's on!

431
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:39,409
There's no sound.

432
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:41,889
Play with the rabbit ears.

433
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:45,249
<i>Reports,
incredible as they seem,</i>

434
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,689
<i>are not the results
of mass hysteria.</i>

435
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:50,769
"Mass hysteria." What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

436
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:51,609
Shut up.

437
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:53,169
In all parts of the country.

438
00:50:53,629 --> 00:50:55,549
This is the latest disclosure in a report

439
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:58,189
from National Civil Defense
headquarters in Washington.

440
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:02,189
It has been established
that persons who have recently died

441
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:06,149
have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.

442
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:11,469
A widespread investigation of reports
from funeral homes, morgues & hospitals

443
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:15,389
has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life

444
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:17,469
and seeking human victims.

445
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:21,229
It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,

446
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:22,789
but it does seem
to be a fact.

447
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:25,509
When this emergency first began,

448
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:29,189
radio and television was
advising people to stay inside,

449
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:31,469
behind locked doors, for safety.

450
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:33,509
Well, that situation
has now changed.

451
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:36,549
We're able to report a definite
course of action for you.

452
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:39,069
Civil defense machinery has been
organized to provide

453
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:42,189
rescue stations with food, shelter,

454
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:45,549
medical treatment and protection
by armed National Guardsmen.

455
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,109
Stay tuned to the broadcasting
stations in your local area

456
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:50,909
for this list of rescue stations.

457
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,909
This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.

458
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:57,229
Look for the name of the rescue
station nearest you,

459
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:00,589
and make your way to that
location as soon as possible.

460
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:03,549
So we have that truck. If we can get
some gas, we can get outta here.

461
00:52:03,629 --> 00:52:06,269
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

462
00:52:06,309 --> 00:52:07,189
But it's locked.

463
00:52:07,229 --> 00:52:09,629
...called this afternoon
by the president.

464
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:12,829
Since convening, this conference
of the presidential cabinet,

465
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:15,709
The FBI, the joint chiefs of staff,
the CIA

466
00:52:15,749 --> 00:52:18,549
has not produced
any public information.

467
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:21,549
Why are space experts
being consulted

468
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,269
about an earthbound emergency?

469
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,498
In other words, you feel that the
radiation on the Venus probe is enough

470
00:52:25,547 --> 00:52:26,606
to cause these mutations?

471
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,100
It was a very high
degree of radiation.

472
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:30,950
Well, just a minute. I'm not sure
that that's certain at all.

473
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,172
- I don't think that has been...
- It's the only logical explanation

474
00:52:33,207 --> 00:52:34,317
that we have at this time.

475
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,390
In other words, it is the military's
viewpoint that this...

476
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,030
the radiation is not
the cause of the mutation.

477
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,870
I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.

478
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,910
I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,

479
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,430
until we, until this
is irrefutably proved.

480
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,670
Everything is being done
that can be done.

481
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,381
We'll have to hurry
for our next meeting.

482
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:52,862
We have to try
to get out of here.

483
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,747
He said the rescue stations have
doctors and medical supplies.

484
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:58,423
If we can get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

485
00:53:02,303 --> 00:53:04,303
Willard. I saw a sign.
That said Willard.

486
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:06,463
It's only about 17 miles from here.

487
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:08,543
You know this area.
Are you from around here?

488
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,223
Judy and I are
both from around here.

489
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:12,663
We were on our way
to the lake to go swimming.

490
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:15,703
Judy had a radio, and we heard
the first reports about this.

491
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:17,743
So we knew the old house
was here and we came in,

492
00:53:17,783 --> 00:53:19,623
and found the lady upstairs, dead.

493
00:53:20,303 --> 00:53:22,943
Then these other people came.
We went down into the basement

494
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:25,543
and put a bar across the door,
and it is pretty strong.

495
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:27,863
How could we possibly
get away from here?

496
00:53:28,063 --> 00:53:32,197
We've got a sick child, two women,
one woman out of her head,

497
00:53:32,232 --> 00:53:35,123
three men, and the place is
surrounded with these things.

498
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:39,327
For NASA.
Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,

499
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:42,023
has been working very hard
to find some solution

500
00:53:42,103 --> 00:53:43,983
to these things
that are happening.

501
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,863
Do you have
any answers at this time?

502
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:50,063
Yes, we have some answers.
But first let me stress the importance

503
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:53,543
of seeking medical attention for anyone
who's been injured in any way.

504
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:56,983
We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.

505
00:53:57,663 --> 00:53:59,223
How bad has your kid been hurt?

506
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:06,783
Look. You go down there and tell...
Judy?

507
00:54:07,023 --> 00:54:09,903
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here
and you stay with the kid, all right?

508
00:54:10,183 --> 00:54:13,063
Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.

509
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:17,383
In the cold room at the university,
we had a cadaver.

510
00:54:17,703 --> 00:54:21,463
A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.

511
00:54:21,903 --> 00:54:23,383
Sometime early this morning,

512
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:26,663
it opened its eyes
and began to move its trunk.

513
00:54:26,703 --> 00:54:30,023
It was dead, but it opened its eyes
and tried to move.

514
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,546
They want you upstairs.

515
00:54:33,763 --> 00:54:36,563
- Did she ask for me?
- She hasn't said anything.

516
00:54:37,643 --> 00:54:38,963
I don't understand.

517
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:43,483
Baby? It's mommy.

518
00:54:44,523 --> 00:54:45,603
I hurt.

519
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:49,483
I'll come back down as soon as
I find out what they want.

520
00:54:50,043 --> 00:54:51,483
Thank you, Judy.

521
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:56,203
The bodies should be disposed of
at once, preferably by cremation.

522
00:54:56,403 --> 00:55:00,083
Well, how long after death, then,
does the body become reactivated?

523
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:02,083
- It's only a matter of minutes.
- Minutes?

524
00:55:02,123 --> 00:55:04,003
That doesn't give people time
to make arrangements...

525
00:55:04,038 --> 00:55:07,483
No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.

526
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,763
The bodies must be carried
to the street and burned.

527
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:15,603
They must be burned immediately.
Soak them with gasoline and burn them.

528
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:18,007
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

529
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,407
We need some bottles or jars

530
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:21,887
to make Molotov cocktails to hold
them off while we try to escape.

531
00:55:21,922 --> 00:55:24,127
Hey! There's a big can
of kerosene down there.

532
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,687
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

533
00:55:26,767 --> 00:55:28,487
There's a big key ring
down there.

534
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:30,767
There may be a key
to the gas pump on it.

535
00:55:31,007 --> 00:55:32,367
I'll check.

536
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:34,767
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

537
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:37,607
Meantime, some of us can go out
and try to get the gas,

538
00:55:37,647 --> 00:55:39,067
then we can come back
for the rest of the people.

539
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,007
But that'll leave
a door open someplace.

540
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,447
Yeah, that's right.
It better be this door.

541
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:45,287
It's closer to the truck.

542
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:48,707
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

543
00:55:48,742 --> 00:55:50,533
While we're gone, the rest of you
can hole up in there.

544
00:55:50,534 --> 00:55:52,294
I found some fruit jars
in the cellar.

545
00:55:52,574 --> 00:55:55,254
And there's a key on here that's
labeled for the gas pump out back.

546
00:55:56,774 --> 00:55:59,774
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

547
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:02,254
I can handle the truck,
no sweat.

548
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:07,654
You're it, then.
You and I'll go.

549
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:15,494
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

550
00:56:16,294 --> 00:56:19,094
You can go upstairs and toss
the cocktails from a window.

551
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:21,694
Tom, you and I will have to
unboard this door.

552
00:56:21,974 --> 00:56:23,334
After you toss the cocktails,

553
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:25,214
you hustle back down here
and lock this door.

554
00:56:25,454 --> 00:56:27,934
It's no good to board it up because
we'll have to get back in quickly.

555
00:56:29,174 --> 00:56:32,174
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

556
00:56:32,294 --> 00:56:34,694
then we'll worry about getting
everybody into the truck.

557
00:56:35,774 --> 00:56:36,974
Now, let's move it.

558
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:40,454
No place to flee for safety,
except for the rescue stations

559
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:41,374
which have been set up.

560
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:45,134
Indications are that
before this emergency is over,

561
00:56:45,174 --> 00:56:48,534
we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.

562
00:56:56,475 --> 00:56:57,995
You always
have a smile for me.

563
00:56:58,336 --> 00:57:00,816
How can you smile like that
all the time?

564
00:57:02,496 --> 00:57:03,896
How many
do you have done?

565
00:57:07,496 --> 00:57:09,096
Come on, honey, we gotta move.

566
00:57:09,936 --> 00:57:11,136
Tom, are you sure about the phone?

567
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:15,176
The phone is dead out.
All you get is a recorded message.

568
00:57:15,656 --> 00:57:19,556
If I could only call the folks. They're
going to be so worried about us.

569
00:57:20,658 --> 00:57:22,243
Everything'll be all right.

570
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:25,614
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll
call them. They might even be there.

571
00:57:26,678 --> 00:57:27,558
I know.

572
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:36,832
Tom... Are you sure we're doing
the right thing, Tom?

573
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,927
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

574
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:41,616
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

575
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:43,673
We've got to get
to a rescue station.

576
00:57:43,979 --> 00:57:45,139
I don't know.

577
00:57:45,419 --> 00:57:47,579
Come on. You're starting
to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

578
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:49,851
But why do you have
to go out there?

579
00:57:49,886 --> 00:57:53,219
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

580
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:55,259
Ben doesn't know anything
about that stuff.

581
00:57:56,939 --> 00:57:58,633
But we're safe in here.

582
00:57:58,668 --> 00:58:01,390
For how long, honey?
We're safe now.

583
00:58:01,425 --> 00:58:03,619
But there's gonna be more
and more of those things.

584
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:05,595
I know.
I know all that.

585
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:13,872
Listen. Remember when
we had the big flood?

586
00:58:14,295 --> 00:58:18,209
Remember how difficult it was for us to
convince you that it was right to leave?

587
00:58:18,516 --> 00:58:21,036
Remember? Remember we had
to go to Willard then?

588
00:58:21,316 --> 00:58:23,396
This isn't a passing thing,
honey.

589
00:58:24,396 --> 00:58:26,996
It... it's not like
just a wind passing through.

590
00:58:27,116 --> 00:58:29,756
We've got to do something,
and fast.

591
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:38,116
I just don't want you
to go out there, that's all.

592
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:40,996
Hey... smile, honey.

593
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:43,636
Where's that big smile
for me?

594
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:50,316
You sure are
no use at all, are you?

595
00:58:50,756 --> 00:58:55,356
We've got work to do, honey.
And you... you...

596
00:59:10,787 --> 00:59:12,295
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

597
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:01,757
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.

598
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:02,997
Ok, toss 'em!

599
01:00:42,077 --> 01:00:43,517
Go ahead! Go on!

600
01:00:58,917 --> 01:00:59,757
I'm going with him!

601
01:01:00,197 --> 01:01:03,277
Get back in the cellar!
It's too late. Too late!

602
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:12,637
Well, is she coming?
Come on.

603
01:01:14,717 --> 01:01:15,517
Get in!

604
01:02:25,217 --> 01:02:26,917
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

605
01:02:26,957 --> 01:02:27,940
Watch it.

606
01:02:33,557 --> 01:02:36,197
Watch the torch!

607
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:43,480
We've gotta get away
from the pump!

608
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:55,590
Hang on!

609
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:59,270
Stop! I'm telling you guys
to get outta the truck!

610
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:18,525
Let's get outta here!

611
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,645
Come on, come on!

612
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:23,490
My jacket's caught.

613
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:29,630
Let me in!

614
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:31,510
Cooper!

615
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,150
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things.

616
01:07:23,803 --> 01:07:25,603
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

617
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:33,123
There's supposed to be another
broadcast at three o'clock.

618
01:07:33,203 --> 01:07:34,483
Ten minutes.

619
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:38,723
Oh. Only ten more minutes?

620
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:41,283
We don't have
very long to wait.

621
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:43,323
We can leave.

622
01:07:44,843 --> 01:07:46,763
Or we better leave soon.

623
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:48,963
It's ten minutes to three.

624
01:07:54,443 --> 01:07:56,443
You know anything
about this area at all?

625
01:07:56,643 --> 01:07:58,523
I mean,
is Willard the nearest town?

626
01:08:00,563 --> 01:08:01,923
I don't know.

627
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:05,198
We were...

628
01:08:08,086 --> 01:08:11,406
Just trying to get
to a motel before dark.

629
01:08:12,526 --> 01:08:14,166
You said those things
turned your car over.

630
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:16,686
You think we can get it back on
its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

631
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:19,006
Seems like it was
pretty far away.

632
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,686
Seems like we ran.

633
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:24,857
Forget it.
It's at least a mile.

634
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,832
Johnny has the keys.

635
01:08:27,046 --> 01:08:29,092
You're going to carry
that child a mile?

636
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:30,744
Through that army
of things out there?

637
01:08:30,779 --> 01:08:32,104
I can carry the kid.

638
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:34,441
What's wrong with her?
How'd she get hurt?

639
01:08:35,326 --> 01:08:38,725
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

640
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:41,618
What's wrong?

641
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,629
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

642
01:08:45,683 --> 01:08:47,839
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

643
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,228
She can't walk.
She's too weak.

644
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,488
Well, one of us could try
to get to the car.

645
01:08:55,523 --> 01:08:56,926
You gonna turn it over
by yourself?

646
01:08:56,966 --> 01:09:00,816
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

647
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,286
You have a car?
Where? Where is it?

648
01:09:06,526 --> 01:09:10,166
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. I know. But where is it?

649
01:09:22,886 --> 01:09:23,926
Good Lord.

650
01:09:38,566 --> 01:09:42,326
At this hour, they report the level
of the mysterious radiation

651
01:09:42,446 --> 01:09:44,406
continues
to increase steadily.

652
01:09:44,926 --> 01:09:46,886
So long as
this situation remains,

653
01:09:47,006 --> 01:09:49,526
government spokesmen warn
that dead bodies

654
01:09:49,566 --> 01:09:52,846
will continue to be transformed
into the flesh-eating ghouls.

655
01:09:52,886 --> 01:09:56,926
All persons who die during
this crisis, from whatever cause,

656
01:09:56,966 --> 01:09:59,526
will come back to life
to seek human victims.

657
01:09:59,606 --> 01:10:02,886
Unless their bodies are
first disposed of by cremation.

658
01:10:03,526 --> 01:10:05,486
Our News cameras
have just returned

659
01:10:05,926 --> 01:10:08,886
from covering such a search and
destroy operation against the ghouls.

660
01:10:08,926 --> 01:10:11,286
This one conducted
by Sheriff Conan McClellan

661
01:10:11,446 --> 01:10:13,206
in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

662
01:10:13,366 --> 01:10:14,966
So now let's go
to that film report.

663
01:10:15,806 --> 01:10:18,726
All law enforcement agencies
and the military

664
01:10:18,806 --> 01:10:22,366
have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.

665
01:10:22,526 --> 01:10:24,646
The survival command center
at the Pentagon

666
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:27,846
has disclosed
that a ghoul can be killed

667
01:10:28,006 --> 01:10:31,806
by a shot in the head
or a heavy blow to the skull.

668
01:10:32,146 --> 01:10:34,086
Officials are quoted
as explaining

669
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:37,646
that since the brain of a ghoul has
been activated by the radiation,

670
01:10:38,046 --> 01:10:41,966
the plan is, kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.

671
01:10:43,086 --> 01:10:46,446
- Want anything from the supply wagon?
- No, we're all right.

672
01:10:47,426 --> 01:10:49,926
Hey, Cass, put that thing
all the way in the fire.

673
01:10:49,966 --> 01:10:52,486
- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right, I gotcha.

674
01:10:52,526 --> 01:10:54,406
Chief McClellan,
how's everything going?

675
01:10:54,446 --> 01:10:57,366
Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

676
01:10:57,766 --> 01:11:00,006
You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.

677
01:11:00,606 --> 01:11:02,326
Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?

678
01:11:02,846 --> 01:11:05,366
Well, we killed 19 of them
today, right in this area.

679
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:08,686
Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.

680
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:11,366
They must have thought somebody
was in there. There wasn't, though.

681
01:11:11,406 --> 01:11:12,926
We heard 'em 
making all kind of noise.

682
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:15,406
We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.

683
01:11:15,446 --> 01:11:17,566
Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?

684
01:11:17,646 --> 01:11:18,406
Yeah, ok.

685
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:21,406
Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,

686
01:11:21,446 --> 01:11:22,686
would I stand
a chance with them?

687
01:11:22,726 --> 01:11:25,206
Well, there's no problem. If you
had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.

688
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:26,326
That's a sure way to kill 'em.

689
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:28,446
If you don't, get yourself
a club or a torch.

690
01:11:28,486 --> 01:11:30,406
Beat 'em or burn 'em.
They go up pretty easy.

691
01:11:30,632 --> 01:11:32,912
Well, chief McClellan,
how long do you think it'll take

692
01:11:32,952 --> 01:11:34,592
until you get the situation
under control?

693
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:37,752
Well, that's pretty hard to say. We
don't know how many of 'em there are.

694
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,472
We know when we find 'em,
we can kill 'em.

695
01:11:40,452 --> 01:11:42,112
Are they slow-moving, chief?

696
01:11:42,312 --> 01:11:45,112
Yeah, they're dead.
They're all messed up.

697
01:11:45,152 --> 01:11:49,192
Well, in time, would you say you'd be
able to wrap this up in 24 hours?

698
01:11:49,552 --> 01:11:52,032
Well, we don't really know.

699
01:11:52,072 --> 01:11:55,552
We know we'll be into it most of the
night, probably into the early morning.

700
01:11:55,592 --> 01:11:57,272
We're working
our way toward Willard

701
01:11:57,312 --> 01:11:59,232
and we'll team up with the
National Guard over there,

702
01:11:59,272 --> 01:12:01,152
and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.

703
01:12:01,312 --> 01:12:02,992
Thank you very much,
chief McClellan.

704
01:12:03,092 --> 01:12:06,512
This is Bill Cardille,
WIC-TV 11 news.

705
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:08,272
Thank you, Bill, for that report.

706
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:11,112
Official spokesmen
declined to speculate

707
01:12:11,152 --> 01:12:13,957
just how long it may
take to kill off all the flesh-eaters

708
01:12:13,992 --> 01:12:15,811
so long as the heavy ra...

709
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:23,277
Is the fuse box
in the cellar?

710
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,088
I don't know. I...

711
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:30,497
Is... Isn't the fuse...

712
01:12:31,592 --> 01:12:32,633
The power lines are down.

713
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:38,512
Helen?
I have to get that gun.

714
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:41,872
Haven't you had enough?

715
01:12:42,712 --> 01:12:45,632
Two people are dead already,
on account of that guy.

716
01:12:45,712 --> 01:12:47,232
Take a look out that window.
Look at...

717
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:44,734
Get over here, man!

718
01:13:46,512 --> 01:13:47,112
Come on!

719
01:14:04,872 --> 01:14:07,747
Go ahead. Go ahead.
You wanna stay up here now?

720
01:14:08,712 --> 01:14:10,255
Helen, get in the cellar.

721
01:14:12,832 --> 01:14:14,442
Get in the cellar now!
Move!

722
01:15:56,671 --> 01:15:57,148
Karen?

723
01:16:04,463 --> 01:16:05,423
Oh, baby.

724
01:16:07,743 --> 01:16:08,732
Baby.

725
01:17:08,503 --> 01:17:11,663
No... no...
No! Johnny!

726
01:17:15,071 --> 01:17:17,641
Somebody help me.

727
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:31,295
Hey, Vince, Bill,

728
01:23:31,742 --> 01:23:34,310
you wanna get about four
or five men and a couple dogs?

729
01:23:34,345 --> 01:23:37,171
There's a house over here behind those
trees. We wanna go check it out.

730
01:23:37,561 --> 01:23:38,820
You still here, Bill?

731
01:23:38,855 --> 01:23:40,295
Yeah, chief,
we're going to stay with it

732
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,790
till we meet up
with the National Guard.

733
01:23:41,825 --> 01:23:43,741
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

734
01:23:43,776 --> 01:23:45,538
- You're doing all the work, take it.
Thank you.

735
01:23:45,573 --> 01:23:48,138
We should be wrapped up here.
About three or four more hours,

736
01:23:48,258 --> 01:23:49,538
we'll probably get
into Willard's end.

737
01:23:49,578 --> 01:23:51,698
I guess you can go over there
and meet the national guard.

738
01:23:51,738 --> 01:23:54,371
Nick, you and the rest
of these men wanna come with me?

739
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:56,378
Bill, I'm checking the office
to see what's happening.

740
01:23:56,658 --> 01:23:59,018
All right, Steve, tell 'em
we're going to stay with it

741
01:23:59,058 --> 01:24:01,858
and everything appears
to be under control.

742
01:24:49,738 --> 01:24:52,351
They need you down there
by the barn.

743
01:24:55,578 --> 01:24:58,072
You guys can follow
the wagon down.

744
01:24:58,107 --> 01:25:00,385
I only need a few men
to check out the house.

745
01:25:02,858 --> 01:25:06,656
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.

746
01:25:43,618 --> 01:25:45,613
He's a dead one.
Get up here!

747
01:25:46,778 --> 01:25:49,066
Nick! Tony! Steve!

748
01:25:49,101 --> 01:25:51,494
You wanna get out in that
field and build me a bonfire?

749
01:26:03,418 --> 01:26:06,053
You. Drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

750
01:26:06,098 --> 01:26:07,268
Nothing down here.

751
01:26:07,303 --> 01:26:09,114
All right. Go ahead down
and give 'em a hand.

752
01:26:09,149 --> 01:26:10,644
Let's go check out the house.

753
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:12,059
There's something there.
I heard a noise.

754
01:26:17,098 --> 01:26:19,415
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head.
Right between the eyes.

755
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:26,411
Good shot. Ok, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

756
01:26:26,446 --> 01:26:27,793
That's another one
for the fire.

757
01:30:07,654 --> 01:30:09,824
Hey Randy,
light these torches over here.
